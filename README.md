# jQuery Peer Mini Challenges

Hey everyone! Here are a series of jQuery challenges that already have code built out, but are missing some component, or some
component is incorrect. Follow the instructions to see if you and your peer can figure out the correction.

Inside this repo, you will find a 'challenges' folder. Work your way through each file within that folder. Complete each of 
the files. Make the changes, save the file, and move onto the next file. Do this until you have completed each of the files.
